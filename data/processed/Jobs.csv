Baker Hughes - Houston, TX
ELP (Electronic Life Prediction): ELP is life estimation software developed by and for Baker Hughes for their drilling tools. This software predicts the life and reliability of drilling tools used by the company. Life prediction provides a cutting-edge way to identify precursors to costly failures in the field and offer proactive guidance during maintenance periods for parts may otherwise have been disregarded based strictly on procedure. Statistical models that relate operating environment to life of the component and are derived from failure data of fielded components, introduce a new way to optimize the efficiency of drilling tools. This is a groundbreaking methodology developed to determine life of components operating in drilling environment by incorporating statistical aspects such as those caused because of variation in operating stress and maintenance upgrades. Since the algorithm utilizes field data, the need for costly laboratory experiments are also eliminated. Each model developed is unique to the specified part and can be calibrated for best fit. Bayesian based model selection technique is used in this software and it incorporates operating environment variables after each successful drilling run to select model that gives the best survival probability for that component. This advanced capability has been developed to update life prediction by dynamically selecting models after each successful drilling run. This ensures maximum utilization of a component, while avoiding failure to improve to overall reliability of the tool while in the field. Presently I am working on developing a tool in Java for the above software along with automation of testing using Python. Responsibilities: • Leading the Automation activity. • Understanding the existing VBA programs. • Implementing a high level design for the overall program. • Implement the entire logic in Java. • Used Eclipse to work on the java code. • White box / unit testing of the Java code with the baseline results from VBA. • Integration of various modules implemented in java and it's testing. • Provide multiple options to accept inputs like XML, database connection, excel file. • Pushed for more streamlined process that reduced much of the manual work involved. • Automated most of the manual and reporting work using Python. • Interaction/meetings with clients and onsite. Environment: Java, Python, VBA, XML, SQL Server, SQL, Eclipse, Windows

La Colonia Medical Centers - Miami, FL
I started to work in this company since I came from Cuba in 2013 and I got my work permit. When I started, this company did not have software to manage the company main processes, there was only one used to manage the transportation built using .net, developed by my co-worker. This company was growing so fast that reached a point where they needed to manage all the processes using software in order to keep that growing and improve it. Using the experience I got from my previous company Desoft in Cuba, one of the biggest, I started to implement each of those processes using Scrum. It was hard because everything was a mess, there was not people with all the technical knowledge required to get the requirements per department. I had to plan a lot of meetings with the departments heads and different employees in order to get all the requirements to be implemented on each iteration. I was doing every step of the software development by myself (I am not a GURU), really a great challenge. In order to finish the different modules in a short period of time, I decided to use the ERP System Odoo, AKA Openerp. This open source software, developed by a Belgium company , uses a framework(Open-object), developed by the same company. This framework was built using the model MVC where they used Jquery, Javascript, XML, Qweb to implement the view layer. They used Python (my preferred programming language) on the controller, and on the model, they used PostgreSQL and an ORM created by themselves using Python. And as plus, I was working the first year and a half as IT too, yes I know, it sounds insane. Configuring printers, scanners, computers, networking, I barely had time to develop and improve myself. Hopefully they understood how important the software is for a company.  Modules developed:  Referral Appointments - Module to manage all the referral appointments related to patients. The company does not has all the required specialists. Sometimes the internal doctors need a second opinion from an external specialist. It really was a chaos on those times because, the referral department had to manage the whole process using excel, good software but not intended for these purposes. I designed and developed, in collaboration with the current department, a module capable of manage the whole process from the beginning to the end. The customer services employees were able to handle the calls in regard of these kind of appointments. Previously they had to call the employees of the Referral Department in order to solve an issue regarding a patient, and since it is very difficult to share information using excel, employees were struggling, because they had to stop what were they doing in order to give the required information. It took me 2 months to finish this module. After designing and creating the business model, I implemented the module in 2 iterations, and a 3 rd iteration to deploy and test. It was a challenge but it was super good to know that this module improved a lot the company processes In this area, and the employees were able to improve their productivity. I keep supporting this module and adding new stuff everyday.  Social Services - Module to manage all the process related to the new patients. The company follows a process where the Social Department has to manage different types of appointments regarding to patient's health insurances. In order to a person become a patient, this has to accomplish certain requirements, such as age, years living in the United States, health insurances. This department was working just using paper and excel. This module was a success because, the employees were able to gather different types of information, such as, amount of patients dis-enrolling, persons nearest to accomplish the requirements, and others. At the beginning I decided to add a  feature to this module, in order to manage outgoing calls to be executed in the future,department's employees were able of schedule calls, but we decided to create a module for customer services later on. The patient follows a process where appointments and calls can be added. At the end of the process, this potential patient is converted as a current patient. Everything was designed to only have a patient's database (for patients and potential patients), and just change the statuses for each process step. Developing time, 2 months, 3 iterations after design.  OTC Services (Over the Counter Medications) - Module to manage the delivery of OTC (Over the Counter medications). The company as I explained in the two previous points, was struggling on this process. Everything was flowing through paper and the telephone, lot of errors, complaints, etc... After receiving the orders with the medications at the different facilities, they had to be sent to the headquarters to be processed, and in order to know the status of the orders, the facilities had to call the OTC department, and then the employees from that department had to be searching on different boxes or they had to call the insurance company, super inaccurate. After some meetings with the department heads, department employees and company heads, we decided to create a process where after receiving an order, the same had to be scanned and uploaded to the patient as a digital order, start the process and complete the required information per status. This was challenging, the process is long, from the point where the order with the desired medications is received to the point where the medications are delivered to the patient. Every step in this process is very important, and different departments participate in this process. Now customer services does not have to be calling this department when they receive a call from a patient regarding an issue, because, every employee with the right access rights is capable of access to the desired information regarding that patient. This took me 3 weeks to design and 2 months to develop, split on 4 iterations, and one week of deployment and testing. I keep supporting, fixing bugs and adding tiny features to this module. We are planning to improve the process , in order to do this we are planning to create a digital sheet, and we want to integrate the module with USPS for the orders that has to be delivered at home by daily mail in order to keep track of the medications after leaving the facilities.  Customer Services - As each department on this company, customer service was struggling. The Customer Services department on any company that offers services, is one of the most important departments, i name it, the firewall department. They were managing all the information got from calls just using paper, what a chaos, complaints, information requested, services requested, messages, everything through paper, the employees had to handle a lot of work. We created a module where, every type of call can be registered. We created 2 main types of calls, outgoing calls and incoming. It was a complete success, now each time the facilities want to know some information related to calls, they do not has to call customer services, they just has to check the system, because the employees from customer services are now very productive and they detail every bit of information on each call. It took me 2 weeks to design and 1 month and a half to develop, two weeks for deployment and testing. I keep giving support, in order to fix bugs and add new features  Human resources - Customized the HR module from Odoo and adapted to the company process. Actually we are planning to add time-sheets, and create new features to improve this important module.  Optometry services - Module to manage all the process of lens delivery.  Under development - Developing a module to help the personnel from Coding and billing to be more productive.  Future developments - Module to manage costs per patient, costs per facility - Install the Odoo module Fleet to manage all the costs of the vehicle fleet. - Install Odoo modules Accounting, Warehouse.

It is flexible for users to customize the views and reports of the market entities based on their choices and requirements like current face value, market value and historical data and other details. Risk is that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by change in market conditions such as market movements. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short term harrowing s, long term debts, trading account assets, liabilities, mortgage, banking activities and derivatives. Market Risk Applications belongs to an architect, engineer, designer, subject matter expert developer, or business expert/analyst supporting technology solutions which effectively influence and lead cross functional teams to extract meaningful & actionable conclusions from the data analyzed; clearly and crisply communicate decisions and opinions.

Programming on Flex/Java/MSTR. MRX is the Market Risk Web Portal which housed specific risk applications such as VaR Reporting and Limits. Market Risk is the risk that the value of assets, liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. Market Risk arises from the fluctuating prices of securities and other investments as they are traded in the global markets. Prices of holdings change on a daily basis. Market Risk always exists, its varying impact, however, is dependant on the external environment.  IRC/CRM Incremental Risk Change/ Comprehensive Risk Measure - All these are used to calculate charges that are needed so that we can adequately sound if ever things blow up. It started monitoring them on weekly basis. When there are changes, we've to explain what caused this change. Since data is so vast and since the calculations are on one file, but the exposures on another we need a tool to marry the two sets. So we can quickly say that our IRC/CRM went up because of x positions. Where this x position decreased y amount or if any new product came in causing the IRC/CRM numbers to change. Impact Analysis Part of the IA development team. Programming on Quartz framework using Python. Quartz is a proprietary Python framework used in Market Risk to build services and both web and desktop front ends on departmental risk applications. Impact Analysis is an application which reports VaR and PnL and other metrics aggregated on Attributes such as Risk Factors, Book Hierarchy, and Regions among other variables. Stressed VaR - Window Scheduling Part of SVaR Window Scheduling team. Based on Bookmarks and Calculation methodologies users are allowed to create new Windows (Official and Temporary).

Baker Hughes
ELP (Electronic Life Prediction): ELP is life estimation software developed by and for Baker Hughes for theirdrilling assemblies. This software predicts the life and reliability drilling tools used by the company. Life prediction provides a cutting-edge way to identify precursors to costly failures in the field and offers proactive guidance during maintenance periods for parts may otherwise have been disregarded based strictly on procedure. Statistical models that relate operating environment to life of the component and are derived from failure data of fielded components, introduce a new way to optimize the efficiency of drilling tools. This is a groundbreaking methodology developed to determine life of components operating in drilling environment by incorporating statistical aspects such as those caused because of variation in operating stress and maintenance upgrades. Since the algorithm utilizes field data, the need for costly laboratory experiments are also eliminated. Each model developed is unique to the specified part and can be calibrated for best fit. Bayesian based model selection technique is used in this software, and it incorporates operating environment variables after each successful drilling run to select model that gives the best survival probability for that component. This advanced capability has been developed to update life prediction by dynamically selecting models after each successful drilling run. This ensures maximum utilization of a component, while avoiding failure to improve to overall reliability of the tool while in the field. My work involves optimizing the existing excel macro as the present VBA code is taking almost 30mis to 1hr for each ELP calculations, and understanding the entire algorithm and formula's used in the existing code, using which a new software needs to be developed in Java. Environment: Python, Java, VBA, XML, Shell scripting, SQL Server, SQL, Eclipse, Windows Responsibilities: • Python developed to segregate SOR/feed information based on mapping documents provided by business to pull and load required fields to tables • Monitoring Python scripts run as daemons in the UNIX/Linux system background to collect trigger and feed arrival information.

Research Assistant on Cumulative Citation Recommendation project. Project aims to filter vital documents for set of entities in an incoming stream of documents. Entities are person/organization/concept from English Wikipedia. A document enhancing existing knowledge about entities is considered as vital. Each document in corpus/dataset has creation time stamp. Proposed system/algorithms should process document in a chronological order. In addition, the proposed systems have constraint of not using information from future. The size of corpus is around 20TB. The work is divided in three subtasks - creation of queries for entities using different approaches, implementation of various statistical information retrieval models and evaluation of the retrieval models. Proposed approaches of query creation include using semantic web data, using judged documents from corpus. Implemented Information retrieval models are Language model, Poisson model, BM25 model and KL Divergence. These models are implemented to process documents in real time (chronological order). Evaluation of models is performed using standard information retrieval measures such as precision, recall and f1 score. We conduct various test such as student t test to effectively compare different models for each of these measures. We create and perform variety of experiments with different parameters for each of the implemented models so as to enable a robust comparison of models.

Sometimes because of non-statistical thinking forecasting can become flawed by even experts in their field. Implementation Online price and volume data is aggregated daily into a MYSQL database.

When the S&P 500 is trending it is better to invest in its direction than against it even for US stocks that are not in the index. While the program written is used here for the S&P500 it could just as easily be used for any other dataset. The recursive neural net I have developed has performed well on the SPY (the sp500).

Responsibilities Positronium (Ps) is the bound state atom formed by an electron and a positron, the anti-particle of the electron. It may be formed by a positron capturing an electron in a material where the free electron density is not very large. Positronium in a material has a lifetime ranging from 0.125 to 142 nanoseconds. When formed in a material, the triplet state annihilation lifetime is reduced due to annihilations of the positron bound in Ps with an electron in the medium. We determined this lifetime experimentally using gamma-ray detectors and timing electronics to measure the distribution of time delays between the formation of Ps and its subsequent decay. In this experiment we measured positron lifetimes in silica gel and zeolite, and studied the relationship between the lifetime and the pore size of the medium. Faculty Mentor: David Schoepf  Skills Used Python, Mathematica, Ortec technology, public speaking, technical writing, power point presentation

The trial is based on research from a group of collaborating investigators who are developing a personalized medicine process that is intended to permit near “real time” processing of information on patient tumors and prediction of best drugs for a specific patient. There were several aspects to the study. One aspect was to reduce the total time it takes to do the genetic sequencing. The process of sequencing generates more than 200 billion measurements per patient that must be analyzed, shared and stored.   My role in reducing the time for sequencing was to implement a BcBio-nextgen pipline. (See the listing below for details)  Another aspect was to develop a VMware cloud where the results of the individual patients sequencing could be displayed. This Linux web based application is know as LightBox. I was responsible for the dev-ops of the VMware cloud, MySQL and Mongo databases, Perl scripts and system integration and system administration of this small cloud base application. One of the focuses of my development was on the conversion of a Linux C++/Qt bit torrent application to be used for securely sharing genetic data. The bit torrent application was developed in Centos, C/C++(g++), Linux thread, with object oriented design and development. The VMware cloud was developed with VMware 5.0, Vsphere, Centos, MySQL, Mongo.  Bcbio-nextgen  Integrate best-practice pipeline for automated analysis of high throughput sequencing data for neurobiology lab. Bcbio-nextgen is an open source Python toolkit that provides automated high throughput sequencing analysis. The pipeline is for taking sequencing results from an Illumina sequencer, converting them to standard Fastq format, aligning to a reference genome, doing SNP calling, and producing a summary. I worked directly with lab bioinformatics personal to install, integrate, build and test this new pipeline. The pipeline is build with many different open source tools. These tools where developed in many different programming languages. A few of the one I dealt with were, PERL, Python, C/C++, Bash. The pipeline was built and ran on a Centos HPC cluster. Using Torque and Maui job queuing.  Large Data Archive Develop a Big Data archive application to archive and restore large genomic data. TGen sequences large volumes of DNA and RNA. Genetic sequencing produces data in the 100s of petabytes. The data is too large for normal backup and recovery tools. Normal copy and rsync take far too long due to the amount of the data. An Archive tool to off load large parts of this data was required. The Archive tool utilizing an HPC cluster copies data to an /arc file system (Sun StorEdge SAM-FS) where the data is stored to tape. The Archive tool is a Linux command line application. The archive reads the data and breaks it up into SLURM jobs. Once the jobs are created. SLURM fires the jobs off on to a list of HPC compute nodes that handle the actually processing. The processing included coping the data files, gathering of metadata that is stored in MySQL database. The archive is developed in PERL, using MySQL, Mongo, Slurm, Subversion, parallelism, Linux threads, Centos, VMware, HPC, Sun StorEdge SAM-FS..

(732) […] Description: Market Risk Strategies provides the information to assess the market risk involved with the market entities. It is flexible for users to customize the views and reports of the market entities based on their choices and requirements like current face value, market value and historical data and other details. Risk is that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by change in market conditions such as market movements. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and/or activities including loans, deposits, securities, short term harrowing s, long term debts, trading account assets, liabilities, mortgage, banking activities and derivatives. Market Risk Applications belongs to an architect, engineer, designer, subject matter expert developer, or business expert/analyst supporting technology solutions which effectively influence and lead cross functional teams to extract meaningful & actionable conclusions from the data analyzed; clearly and crisply communicate decisions and opinions. Utilizes knowledge of technological alternatives, business requirements, and business environments to support or maintain technology solutions which provides management and guidance to support achieving business objectives.  MRX Part of the MRX development team. Programming on Flex/Java/MSTR. MRX is the Market Risk Web Portal which housed specific risk applications such as VaR Reporting and Limits. Market Risk is the risk that the value of assets, liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. Market Risk arises from the fluctuating prices of securities and other investments as they are traded in the global markets. Prices of holdings change on a daily basis. Market Risk always exists, its varying impact, however, is dependant on the external environment.  IRC/CRM Incremental Risk Change/ Comprehensive Risk Measure - All these are used to calculate charges that are needed so that we can adequately sound if ever things blow up. It started monitoring them on weekly basis. When there are changes, we've to explain what caused this change. Since data is so vast and since the calculations are on one file, but the exposures on another we need a tool to marry the two sets. So we can quickly say that our IRC/CRM went up because of x positions. Where this x position decreased y amount or if any new product came in causing the IRC/CRM numbers to change. Impact Analysis Part of the IA development team. Programming on Quartz framework using Python. Quartz is a proprietary Python framework used in Market Risk to build services and both web and desktop front ends on departmental risk applications. Impact Analysis is an application which reports VaR and PnL and other metrics aggregated on Attributes such as Risk Factors, Book Hierarchy, and Regions among other variables. Stressed VaR - Window Scheduling Part of SVaR Window Scheduling team. Based on Bookmarks and Calculation methodologies users are allowed to create new Windows (Official and Temporary) .

One of the Key Projects: D-Log Data Processing Using Hadoop-MapReduce Framework The main aim of this project was to extract business values from the large volume of messy unstructured/semi-structured/structured data. D-Log burst and shell scripts were used to load the data onto HDFS/Netezza Database. Iterative analytical process (research questions -> data wrangling <-> feature extraction <-> model development <-> model evaluation -> interactive visualization to answer questions) was used with appropriate Statistical techniques and Machine learning algorithms using custom Map Reduce programs, Hive, Pig, Python, and R. Also, for the OLAP type of operational usages, a query-utility was developed to extract meaningful information from nicely organized Hive external tables.

Quantitative modeling - Daily S&D and forward looking S&D forecast for L48 and regional natural gas supply and demand (S&D) modeling for lower 48 states.  Daily regressions of pipe nominations, no notice volumes, proprietary observations - powerburn , cems , earthsat provided gas hdds/cdds  and various other independent variables against EIA reported data.  15 day forecasts are based on Earthsat forecast for the next 15 days against EIA reported supply and demand.  Two year forecasts are used to provide a range of end of season storage and daily storage changes based on smoothed weather inputs from the last 30 years. ◆ Components of the S&D include production, power burn, residential and commercial demand, industrial demand, canadian and mexican imports and exports, lease and plant fuel, lng sendouts and storage. ◆ Daily observed production is based on nominations observed on pipes in the producing regions.   Forecast production is based on declines observed on historical state level production data from HPDI and rig counts based on Rig Data.  Power burn uses a multivariate regression of nominations , CEMS gas burn and EIA.  Forecasts are weather based. Residential and commercial demand uses a regression model of nominations, regional weather and EIA provided demand.  Imports and exports for Western and Eastern Mexico and Canada are calculated based on actual noms are the various points on pipes into and out of the US.  Industrial demand is calculated on noms at large industrial customer meters and taking into account various macroeconomic indices published by the federal reserve.  Lease and plant fuel is calculated based on outputs of the daily and forecast production model proportionate the amount of production in the various EIA regions. ◆ Decline curve models use historical HPDI data compiled from state data.  It fits linear, exponential or hyperbolic curves to the actual historical production data from each play and vintage.  The coefficients generated for each play and vintage are then use to predict declining production of wells in various plays.  Forecast production for oil and gas is generated off these coefficients and number of working rigs and rig efficiency. ◆ Tools used for the calculation of the above reports include R, Python, Matlab.  Reports generated using various publishing tools such as Report Lab, Adobe Indesign, Flask, Pandas ◆ Team size: 8 people across Boulder and Houston.  One fundamental analyst, one modeler, six pipe analyst focused on pipe data and metadata associated with categorization of the noms
